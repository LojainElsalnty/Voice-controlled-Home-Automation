# Voice-controlled-Home-Automation
The "Voice-Controlled Home Automation" project is designed to enable users to interact with home devices using voice commands.


# Subsystem 1: (concurrent)


Upon entering the room and issuing the "GOOD MORNING" voice command (Laptop’s microphone – the laptop will process the command using voice recognition), the system responds by turning on the light
  and playing a predetermined song on the laptop’s speaker. The voice command "GOODNIGHT" initiates the shutdown sequence. This command triggers the system
  to turn off the lights and play a designated song to facilitate a soothing atmosphere.



# Subsystem 2:


 Additionally, the user can open/close the window shutter (motor) by making a specific gesture (infrared sensor).
